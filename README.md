# VBA Macro Documentation and Transformation Tool

## Overview
This project aims to develop a tool that automates the documentation and understanding of legacy VBA macros used in critical processes across DFIN. The tool facilitates the transformation of these macros into modern technologies and IT platforms.

## Objective
The goal is to develop a solution that automates the documentation and understanding of VBA macros, enabling their transition to more modern, efficient solutions.

## Requirements
1. **Macro Analysis Tool:** Develop or procure a platform that can analyze VBA macros, extracting and documenting the logic, data flow, and process flow automatically.
2. **Technology Integration:** Utilize advanced technologies such as GenAI and Machine Learning to interpret the VBA code and generate comprehensive documentation.
3. **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide an intuitive interface for end-users to input macro-contained Excel files and receive detailed analysis.
4. **Reliability and Accuracy:** Ensure the platform produces reliable and accurate documentation to support the seamless transformation of legacy tools.

## Deliverables
1. **Demonstration:** A live demonstration of the macro analysis tool, showcasing its ability to document and explain VBA macro logic accurately.
2. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation covering the platformâ€™s architecture, analysis algorithms, and user interface design.
3. **Presentation:** A presentation summarizing the problem addressed, the developed solution, and its potential impact on modernizing and documenting legacy VBA macros.
4. **Git Repository:** Submission of the codebase on a Git repository with all the necessary permissions.

## Project Structure
